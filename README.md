Weather DashBoard using HTML,CSS,JavaScript
Steps to achieve this project:
1.Create a folder. You can name this folder whatever you want, and inside this folder, create the mentioned files.
2.Create an index.html file. The file name must be index and its extension .html
3.Create a style.css file. The file name must be style and its extension .css
4.Create a script.js file. The file name must be script and its extension .js

->To start, add the following HTML codes to your index.html file. This code includes a weather app header, input, button, and unordered list (ul) that are used as a placeholder for weather details. Later, using JavaScript, we’ll replace these placeholders with actual weather details.

->Next, add the following CSS codes to your style.css file to apply visual styling to your weather app. Now, if you load the web page in your browser, you will see the header at the top, a sidebar with input and buttons, and weather detail placeholders. You can customize this code to your liking by adjusting the color, font, size, and other CSS properties

->Finally, add the following JavaScript code to your script.js file. This script code will make your weather app functional, which means now you can get a 5-day weather forecast for any city or your current location.

->Please note that your weather app is still unable to show the weather forecast for any location because you’ve not provided your OpenWeatherMap API key in the API_KEY variable. To get a free API key, sign up for an account at [https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys]. Your API key may take minutes or hours to activate. You’ll get an error like “Invalid API Key” or something similar during this time.

->In conclusion, building a weather app project allows you to apply your web development skills to a real-world application. Also, it helps you to better understand DOM manipulation, Event handling, CSS styling, APIs, and more. I hope that by following the steps in this post, you’ve successfully created your weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
